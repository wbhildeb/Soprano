    This project was the final assignment for my CS246 - Object Oriented Software Development class at University of Waterloo.
    I am quite proud of this project as it was initially intended to be a three person project, however I worked in a team of only two people.
    Nevertheless my partner and I were able to achieve a grade of 105% due to excellent design and enhancements that swe added to the program.

    The premise of the assignment was to create a two-player, command-line version of Tetris from scratch.
    The only library used was one provided by the professors for implementing graphics with X11.
